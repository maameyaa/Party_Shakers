# Party_Shakers Employee Page
An online shop for all essential party supplies. 

The first page on the website which is the empSite.php will enable you access the Employee Page. You will have to login to access further information. Employee Login details are stated in the database. You can choose any employee detail to login. 

After logging in, you access the EmployeePage.php  page where it displays customer orders and provides few features to view order and update shipping order. Employees that have 'Admin' status can login again to access Admin page(admin.php) in order to view details of Employees and make any changes. 

Features like Search, Edit, Add, Delete are available on the Employee Page. As an eCommerce platform, a disclaimer page has been provided in order to potentially protect our site and usability of information by employees. A contact page has also been created in case employees need that information. An error 404 page is created to redirect all users that dont have access to the Employee Page after unsuccessful login. The sql was populated locally in order to fully test functions implemented.

Further features are yet to be updated:

Order reports - by day, week, & month
